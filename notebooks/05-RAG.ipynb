This perspective indicates that the public may not be as polarized as often portrayed, suggesting a more unified sentiment on certain issues.\\n\\nConversely, other articles touch on more negative sentiments. For instance, there is a report on declining home builder sentiment, which has fallen for two consecutive months after reaching an 11-year high post-election [11]. This decline may reflect broader economic concerns among builders and could indicate a cautious outlook on the housing market.\\n\\nOverall, while there are elements of positivity regarding national sentiment, particularly in the context of social issues, there are also significant concerns reflected in economic indicators, suggesting a complex and nuanced view of sentiment towards the USA.\\n</div>\\n<h4>Showing 20 Results for <em>What is the sentiment of the articles about the USA?</em></h4>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n    <b>Terry Glavin: A second Civil War?

This vulnerability adds to the skepticism expressed by prominent figures in the financial sector, with some Wall Street CEOs labeling cryptocurrencies as \\\"fraud\\\" or dismissing them as a mere \\\"fad\\\" [3].\\n\\nIn a related development, the U.S. government has taken a firm stance against certain cryptocurrencies by issuing an executive order that bans the use or purchase of Venezuela's Petro coin. This action underscores the geopolitical dimensions of cryptocurrency regulation and the potential for digital currencies to be used in ways that conflict with U.S. foreign policy objectives [4][5].\\n\\nIn conclusion, the cryptocurrency industry is currently facing a multifaceted crisis characterized by regulatory challenges, security vulnerabilities, and critical perceptions from influential financial leaders. These factors collectively contribute to the ongoing \\\"crypto scandal,\\\" highlighting the need for increased oversight and security measures within the sector.\\n</div>\\n<h4>Showing 5 Results for <em>crypto scandal</em></h4>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n    <b>Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies plunge on wave of bad news</b>(0.5)<br>\\n    Google said it will ban cryptocurrency-related ads, the IMF called for global regulation and members of Congress slammed them at a hearing Wednesday.<br>\\n    <span style=\\\"font-size:0.8em\\\"><a href=\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/bitcoin-other-cryptocurrencies-plunge-wave-bad-news-n856821?cid=public-rss_20180320\\\">https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/bitcoin-other-cryptocurrencies-plunge-wave-bad-news-n856821?cid=public-rss_20180320</a></span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    <b>AP Explains: Why are crypto exchanges vulnerable to hacks?</b>(0.5)<br>\\n    AP Explains: Why are crypto exchanges vulnerable to hacks?<br>\\n    <span style=\\\"font-size:0.8em\\\"><a href=\\\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3353987\\\">https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3353987</a></span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    <b>‘Fraud.’ ‘More than a fad.’ The words Wall Street CEOs are using to describe bitcoin</b>(0.4184984)<br>\\n    Seems not a day goes by without some Wall Street VIP or financial luminary deciding it’s time for them to weigh in on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
