This perspective indicates that the public may not be as polarized as often portrayed, suggesting a more unified sentiment on certain topics.\\n\\nConversely, other articles touch on more negative sentiments. For instance, there is a report on declining home builder sentiment, which has fallen for two consecutive months after reaching an 11-year high post-election [11]. This decline may reflect broader economic concerns among builders, indicating a more cautious outlook in that sector.\\n\\nOverall, while there are signs of optimism in some areas, such as public sentiment towards immigration, there are also indicators of concern, particularly in the housing market. This duality suggests that the sentiment surrounding the USA is complex and varies significantly depending on the specific context being discussed.\\n</div>\\n<h4>Showing 10000 Results for <em>What is the sentiment of the articles about the USA?</em></h4>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n    <b>Terry Glavin: A second Civil War?
